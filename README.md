# Kill_The_Fly_Verilog

The game is written in Verilog and running on DE1-SoC board, which supports to use a PS/2 Keyboard as a input and VGA output.

Basically there are four fruits and flies would keep flying in from the left of the screen and randomly stop on one of the fruits. 
You should press the corresponding key to hit flies during the period they stay on the fruit to score 1 point. If you hit the wrong key 
your will lose 1. Score of 10 and 20 are two thresholds where the game would accelerate and flyies' stay period would be shorter.
The game will last 45 seconds. A full demo video is here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AU9jjgRejbk
